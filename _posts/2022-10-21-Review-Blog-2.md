## Summary
The Nba Redrafted 2.0 is a DH project that focuses on redrafting all NBA players that have been selected since 2017. The website uses data from other websites and four advanced statistics (VORP, Win Shares, RAPTOR WAR, and Wins Added) to create a rating for each player. Each statistic was modified, and an overall average was developed to create a master scale of a player's rating from 0 to 100. Ratings were based on a player's top five seasons to balance their prime years with their longevity.

The site only shows draft classes through 2017 because players must have at least five years of data. The following formula was used to determine draft picks' report card grades: Potential was the rating gap between a player and the best player available in that draft when they were selected, and the athlete received an A+ if they were the best player available. The remaining grades were evenly distributed, with a uniform number of players receiving each grade value.

## Design
The technology used to run the site is not available, but the interface is very clean and straightforward. The data is lined up in a way that's easy to see and access. Several paragraphs break down what the user sees and how it relates to the project's goal. The Presence of interactive and visual elements makes the site fun and engaging. 

## Content 
As previously stated, a ton of analytical data is presented throughout this project. Not only does the project give data on players that have been drafted, but they provide data on the teams that drafted them as well. They compile the draft grades from every player a team has drafted up until 2017 and determine how often a team has drafted the correct player during their drafts. 

For example, per the data collected, the New Orleans Pelicans select the correct player 27.3% of the time, which is the highest percentage, and the Washington Wizards have selected the correct player 0.0% of the time, meaning since 1989, they have never selected the best player available to them during the draft.

The site also gives insight into what players should have been drafted over others. For example, in 2007, The Portland Trailblazers selected Greg Oden when they could have chosen Kevin Durant, who turned out to be the best player available. The site also provides a visual of each player when presenting this, which I think is a neat touch.

## Relevance 
The project does an excellent job of utilizing innovation and technology to break down data from NBA draft classes in a digestible way. In a perfect world, every NBA team would select the best player available every time they picked during the draft. However, the NBA draft is frequently just a big guessing game. This project gives context to the casual fan about how difficult it is to get it right during the draft and how easy it is for teams to make decisions they regret down the line.

## Credit
The site does not spend much time giving credit to the creators of the site beyond displaying who wrote the article at the top of the page. However, The creator's name is presented as a link that takes the user to a second page that gives insight into who the article's writer is.

The term “we” is used constantly throughout this article, which you would expect considering there’s so much data and research that was put into making this project. I think it would be good to give credit to the other members who contributed to the research that went into this project instead of putting one name on the entire thing. 

## Findings/Usability 
The website's UI is incredibly user-friendly and fluid. You are immediately presented with information that is presented to you in an interactive way. As previously stated, You can select any team in the league from a drop-down menu and examine who they selected in a specific draft class compared to the top players available when that player was selected. The players in the section are also color-coded to give the user context as to who’s considered the better player.

Additionally, When viewing the draft percentages of a team, you can click on a team and view every player that the team has drafted since 1989. You can also see the draft grades given by the site and the number of better players available when that player was selected. Below is an example of this from the Portland Trailblazers

Categorizing each player by the team that drafted them allows the page's design to stay clean and organized. However, it may be challenging to find certain players if you’re not already aware of what team they were drafted to. Adding a search bar that allows you to search for specific players would be helpful, especially if they were given a lower draft grade because they could be lost in a cluster of players on a team you didn’t know they were a part of. 

As you move farther down the page, you are presented with a sliding tool that allows you to look at each draft class since 1989 and see how much each class has changed with the redraft. In this graphic, players are categorized by how many spots they moved up or down in their class in addition to being color coded. 

The site also seems to be very well-optimized for mobile devices. I found no issues trying to navigate the site on my phone. All the interactive features work the same, and the text is compressed into a vertical format that remains easy to read and understand. 

Overall The Nba Redrafted 2.0 is a well-designed and executed project that serves as an improvement over its predecessor. It does a remarkable job of converting a large amount of analytical data into an engaging and easily digestible form of media that not only enlightens users about the difficulty of selecting good players in the draft but of the unpredictability of an NBA player's career. 

Like my project, this site uses data and analytics to back its rankings. This site's application of analytical data will help me greatly in determining the best way to rank the players I select for my project. The site is very precise with the data they use to evaluate the teams and players in the article, and I believe it would be wise of me to follow their method of research.
