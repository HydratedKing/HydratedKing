## Summary
The Putler Project is a DH project which offers ways to access Hester Putler’s poetry. The Pulter Project website uses various resources, including explanatory materials, and two ways to access Pulter's poetry, which are offered in amplified and elemental versions. 

According to the website, the elemental versions “deliberately pare-down modernizations with minimal notes,” and the amplified versions "foreground different aspects of Pulter’s verse." This project aims to bring light to the works of Hester Pulter, who has seen a vast majority of their work go unnoticed. 

## Design

The leading technology used in this project is XML. TEI-XML and static HTML are also employed to keep the project running smoothly. The interface is very clean and straightforward when I first click on the site. 

There is a brief summary of what the site contains, three links that allowed me to navigate the content within the project, and a video to watch. The summary and video provided an introduction to the website, but there was not much valuable information in these sections.

## Content 
The Project offers tons of information not only about the work of Hester Pulter but about their life as well. It was helpful to have background information about the poet because it makes the website more personal and allows users to feel more connected to the work they're looking at. The elemental and amplified versions of the poems are also a great addition. 

The elemental version of the poem highlights certain words within the poem and gives you their definitions. In contrast, the amplified versions take this a step further by showing the reader the definitions and critical notes that explain the purpose the word serves in the poem and other poems in the manuscript where the term can be found.

## Relevance 
The project does an excellent job of utilizing innovation and technology to translate Pulter's works in an interactive and digestible way. The project stands out because it attempts to show the intricacy of Pulter's poetics and the opportunities provided by academic editing in the digital era. The Pulter Project aims to make readers aware of the frequently hidden choices that shape poetry and poets rather than simply presenting the finished product without context.

## Credit
The project does a great job of making sure to give credit to its creators. In the “Who” section of the website, dozens of names are displayed along with their roles and alma maters. The leading forces behind the creation of the project are Wendy Wall and Leah Knight, who come from Northwestern University and Brock University respectfully. 

## Findings/Usability 
The links provided to me on the front page (Preface, Poems, and Discoveries) were beneficial in my navigation of the site. Two links (Preface & Discoveries) provided pop-up menus that allowed me to quickly navigate to other site areas and provided additional information about what it entailed. The Poems link took me straight to the 120 poems that are seemingly the foundation of the project.

The tabs within the Poems are laid out neatly and allow the user to easily click through and access the bountiful information offered by the site. The site can be challenging to navigate as some tabs require extra steps to access the information you want to see. For example, when you click the manuscript tab, a small icon appears on the left 
side of the screen. You must locate and click this icon before accessing the manuscript. I think it would be helpful if this extra step was removed and the manuscript simply popped on the screen when the tab was clicked, as the small icon can go unnoticed.

When accessing the side-by-side version of the poem, you are met with a screen that displays two versions of the poem, along with sources that give credit to its creators. You are also met with tabs on the top of the screen that allows you to toggle pages on and off and add additional pages to the ones already presented to you. If you add pages, the space can get cluttered and overwhelming as the new items just stack on top of each other. 

However, a feature not mentioned is that you can move the pages around slightly to allow a better view of everything you want to see. If you scroll down, a massive space at the bottom of the screen will enable you to place new icons that you have opened up. While this design is undoubtedly convenient, I think it would be beneficial if the tabs simply appeared in the empty spaces on the page instead of just stacking on top of one another. This would be much more efficient and less overwhelming for the reader as they read and navigate through new tabs.

The project also seems to be much better optimized for desktop and computer devices than mobile ones. Trying to navigate the project on my phone proved difficult as several features were not present, including the click and drag component in the side-by-side portion of the poems. Also, the inability to zoom in on mobile devices makes it difficult to read some of the smaller text presented in the project.

Overall The project is well-designed and executed. It does a remarkable job of converting a historical poet's works into an engaging and easily digestible form of media that not only enlightens users about the life of the said poet but also offers a window into the poetic process.
