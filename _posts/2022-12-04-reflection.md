This course has greatly expanded my knowledge of the Digital Humanities (DH) sector. I had never heard of digital humanities before this course, much less had a clear understanding of what it was. Interestingly, one of my biggest takeaways from this class is that there isn't one definition for digital humanities; rather, a variety of interpretations from those that study the field. After studying the subject for a semester, I believe that the knowledge I have gained would allow me to define digital humanities as the process of integrating humanistic disciplines with aspects of the digital world.

Various factors contributed to my understanding of DH, particularly the readings and the various assignments we were required to do throughout the course. While it is true that DH is a bit of an ambiguous topic, reading articles from people who are educated on the subject was helpful in terms of my understanding of what we were learning. They also helped with my writing process as well. Shitty first drafts, text scanning patterns, and What is a Digital Humanities Project were just a few of the articles that I found to be incredibly helpful in my writing and project development. Twitter was a valuable tool in helping us engage with the readings because not only did it give us the incentive to read them, but it forced us to think critically about what we were reading and engage with the various ways in which our peers interpreted the texts.

The readings were undoubtedly helpful, but the best part of the course was getting to see and analyze other DH projects. The review blogs were a challenging yet rewarding assignment in this class. This was the first course I've taken where evaluation was a point of emphasis. It was more difficult than I had anticipated initially, mainly because I wasn’t clear about what we were looking for when we first started reviewing these DH projects. Naturally, I wanted to pick out every little thing within each project, but after some trial and error, I was able to make my evaluation more focused and concentrate on things that were important in successful DH projects.

I enjoyed doing the second review blog more than I did the first. Between figuring out what to look for and what to address and the fact that I was examining a project that was not particularly interesting to me, I found the first review blog to be more stressful than I would have liked. That being said, it was still an essential part of my growth in the course because I got a good sense of how I should approach evaluating DH projects, and it made the next review I did flow much more smoothly. I enjoyed the second review blog because I could choose something I enjoyed. Not only was I able to pick a topic that interested me, but I learned a ton of new information about it in the process, making me eager to explore it more outside of the classroom. Allowing us to apply our own interests to the classroom was great because it made the projects easier to engage with and complete.

Improving my evaluation skills wasn’t something I expected coming into the course, but I can confidently say that I have improved in that area. I also think I have made strides as a writer as well. A big point of emphasis in our writing was conciseness. As a writer, I often find myself having a lot to say, especially when I'm being asked to give an observation or opinion. I think one of the most important skills I learned was avoiding jargon and emphasizing important and relevant information. This is crucial in a day and age where people aren’t looking to engage with long, drawn-out information. This is a skill that I’ve seen improvement in and am grateful was introduced. 

In conclusion, I found this course to be very rewarding and insightful. Not only did I improve as a writer, but I also made strides as a digital humanist, and for that, I would consider this course a success.
