# About Me

![Alt Text](https://hydratedking.github.io/HydratedKing/images/Malcolm_CNU.jpeg)

My name is Malcolm King, and I am a Junior at Christopher Newport University (CNU), Majoring in Communication studies with minors in Leadership and Digital Humanities. 

I'm Involved with the President's Leadership program and the Phi Sigma Pi honor society here at CNU. I also participate in intramural sports here on campus. 

I am from Doswell, Virginia, and attended Patrick henry high school. While there, my interest in media production was sparked by my involvement in the Tv production course. My involvement with the school yearbook was beneficial as well. Due to these classes, I had already decided what I wanted to study by the time I was ready to enroll in college and leaped without hesitation into communications.
I was unfamiliar with digital humanities until last school year, when I decided to take on the subject as part of my academic journey. Admittedly, I don’t know much about digital humanities, but I think that adds to the excitement of taking a course like ENGL350 as it allows me to learn and expand my knowledge. 

My ultimate goal is to work in the media in some capacity. I’ve always been interested in content creation (filming/editing), so as I have progressed in my academic journey, I have begun to take the necessary steps to enhance my skills so that I can do that professionally. 
This summer, I spent time interning at Virginia Public media (VPM). While there, I spent time editing and creating social media content for Virginia Home Grown, a show produced by the company. While working for them, I gained experience with adobe premiere pro and was introduced to other platforms such as adobe after effects.  

Most of my time was spent editing [ Q & A Videos for their Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/VirginiaHomeGrown/videos/growing-strawberries/464441492176811) and creating content for their Instagram account. However, I was also able to go on film shoots and sit in on lives shows during the time I spent there. I think the time I spent working for them this summer was very valuable, and I plan on returning this upcoming summer to continue to learn and expand my skill set. 

I spend most of my spare time playing basketball with my friends, watching movies and tv shows, and playing Madden. As far as tv shows go, I am currently wrapped up in Better Call Saul. As a huge Breaking Bad fan, I felt obligated to watch the series at some point, and so far, I haven’t been disappointed. 
I am also a huge Philadelphia Eagles fan, and in just a few short weeks, my life will be completely consumed by them for the 10th year in a row. I say without shame that I am completely ready to have my heart broken by them yet again this year. 

I feel that it is also important to mention that I love movies. My favorite is *The Shawshank Redemption*, which I believe is undoubtedly the greatest movie ever made. My other favorite films include *Good Will Hunting*, *A Silent Voice*, *The Hunt*, *Your Name*, and *Spider-Man 2*. 

I feel that being in this course will not only give me an opportunity to enhance my writing abilities, but it will help expand my knowledge on a topic that I am quite unfamiliar with, which is always fun. I say all this to say I'm excited to be in ENGL350 and am looking forward to getting started!
